#In python you have your editor and your console, what youre reading rn is in your editor
#this is where ur code goes
#your console is where your output goes
#if you want to send messages that will be outputted to the console we use the    print()    command
#example:
print("\nhello world!")
#within the print function we can perform basic python tasks, like adding/subtracting variables, or direct values

print("\nhello" + " world")

print("\n",22 + 45)

numberVariable = 30

print("\n",numberVariable +  72)

print("\n by using the + operator we ADD the variables and values together, if you simply want to print them seperatly you seperate them by a comma")

stringVariable = "hello world!"

print("\n like this:  ", numberVariable, "  heres some more string text  ", stringVariable)
